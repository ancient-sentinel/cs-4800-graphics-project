  > Object tracking using a centroid tracking algorithm with OpenCV. Provides a simple framework for tracking objects when bounding-box coordinates for the objects can be provided for every frame. The bounding-box coordinates are then reduced to their centroid and centroids are matched across frames according to the assumption that the difference in position for a particular object between frames is smaller than all other distances between objects. Objects that are lost or disappear are deregistered when they cannot be matched to any existing objects for a certain number of frames.
