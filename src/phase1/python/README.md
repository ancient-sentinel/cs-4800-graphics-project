# Python Code for Phase 1
A repository for Python code developed in Phase 1. 

## Files:
 - `FramesofVideo.py` : Extracts the individual frames from a video file. 
 - `VideoCreator.py` : Generates a video file from a sequence of frames. 
 - `MultiTrackerTest.py` : A test of the MultiTracker functionality available in OpenCV. Three tracking algorithms 
 are considered: Kernalized Correlation Filters (KCF), Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks (GOTURN), 
 and Descriminative Correlation Filter Tracker with Channel and Spacial Reliability (CSRT).
