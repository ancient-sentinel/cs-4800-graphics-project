# Phase 1 Python Code
A repository for Python code developed in Phase 1. 

## Files:

 - `BuildDataSet.py` : A utility for creating a data set directory structure from a set of images and corresponding annotations.
 
 - `CannyEdgeTest.py` : A script testing the use of a Canny edge detector to attempt to identify bowls within a frame.
 
 - `ContoursTest.py` : A script testing the use of contours to attempt to find bowls within a frame.
 
 - `FramesofVideo.py` : Extracts the individual frames from a video file. 
 
 - `HoughCircles.py` : A script testing the use of a Hough circles algorithm to attemp to find bowls within a frame. 
 
 - `MultiTrackerTest.py` : A test of the MultiTracker functionality available in OpenCV. Three tracking algorithms 
 are considered: Kernalized Correlation Filters (KCF), Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks (GOTURN), 
 and Descriminative Correlation Filter Tracker with Channel and Spacial Reliability (CSRT). 
 
  - `VideoCreator.py` : Generates a video file from a sequence of frames.
